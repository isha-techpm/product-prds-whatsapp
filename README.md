## ⭐ Overview  
This repository contains a set of **self-written Product Requirement Documents (PRDs)** where I analyze gaps in WhatsApp’s core experience and propose practical product enhancements.  
Each PRD includes:  
- Problem framing  
- User pain points  
- Proposed solution  
- Feature details  
- UX flows and mockups

These PRDs reflect my approach as a **Product Manager**:  
user-centric thinking, structured analysis, clear prioritization, and practical feature design.
